This is a sample webpage i created using HTML3, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript/ES6 as an Events page of a recruiting company. 
Check out the webpage at https://rafatmunshi.github.io/FrontEnd-Sample/
It takes events details from a server in the JSON format, parses it and populates on the page.
It has share to LinkedIn feature for each events which would post their respective details as a linkedIn post/message.
A user can apply for all free Events, however for Premium Events they won't be able to.
A user can also view details of the Event.
There are two tabs to populate the upcoming as well as previous events.
It's top navigation bar is made sticky and a bottom arrow is made visible when user has scrolled beyond 1200 px which directly scrolls to the top.
All icons are used of fontawesome and images are from unsplash.com

Further work required-
Although many elements of the page is responsive, however some elements do not show responsive behaviour as of now.
Populating the previous events using fetch call with the other link is to be implemented as well.

However for the purposes of the exercises, it was more than sufficient for me. Hope it helps!
